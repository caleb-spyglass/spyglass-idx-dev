As Austin's metro area continues to expand, communities like Amanda are seeing steady appreciation and growing interest from buyers who recognize the value proposition of the outer ring.

For buyers seeking space, privacy, and a more relaxed pace of life while still maintaining access to Austin's amenities and employment, Oak Hollow represents an appealing option in a rapidly growing region.

Properties in Oak Hollow often feature larger lots and more square footage than you'll find closer to downtown, and the community benefits from the natural beauty of the surrounding Texas Hill Country landscape. The area is served by Eanes ISD, Lake Travis ISD, or Round Rock ISD, and while you'll find essential services and shopping nearby, the appeal here is as much about what you're close to as what you're away from — namely, congestion and density.

As Austin's metro area continues to expand, communities like Oak Hollow are seeing steady appreciation and growing interest from buyers who recognize the value proposition of the outer ring. Access to Loop 360 (Capital of Texas Highway) keeps the commute manageable, and the quality of life is hard to beat. Contact Spyglass Realty to explore what's available in Oak Hollow.`,

For buyers seeking space, privacy, and a more relaxed pace of life while still maintaining access to Austin's amenities and employment, Wallace Addition represents an appealing option in a rapidly growing region.

Properties in Wallace Addition often feature larger lots and more square footage than you'll find closer to downtown, and the community benefits from the natural beauty of the surrounding Texas Hill Country landscape. The area is served by Hays CISD, Dripping Springs ISD, or San Marcos CISD, and while you'll find essential services and shopping nearby, the appeal here is as much about what you're close to as what you're away from — namely, congestion and density.

As Austin's metro area continues to expand, communities like Wallace Addition are seeing steady appreciation and growing interest from buyers who recognize the value proposition of the outer ring. Access to I-35 and Ranch Road 12 keeps the commute manageable, and the quality of life is hard to beat. Contact Spyglass Realty to explore what's available in Wallace Addition.`,

For buyers seeking space, privacy, and a more relaxed pace of life while still maintaining access to Austin's amenities and employment, Willow Creek represents an appealing option in a rapidly growing region.

Properties in Willow Creek often feature larger lots and more square footage than you'll find closer to downtown, and the community benefits from the natural beauty of the surrounding Texas Hill Country landscape. The area is served by Hays CISD, Dripping Springs ISD, or San Marcos CISD, and while you'll find essential services and shopping nearby, the appeal here is as much about what you're close to as what you're away from — namely, congestion and density.

As Austin's metro area continues to expand, communities like Willow Creek are seeing steady appreciation and growing interest from buyers who recognize the value proposition of the outer ring. Access to I-35 and Ranch Road 12 keeps the commute manageable, and the quality of life is hard to beat. Contact Spyglass Realty to explore what's available in Willow Creek.`,
